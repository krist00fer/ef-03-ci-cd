# Instructions - Medium

Start by “forking” (remember a “fork” is a server-side clone) the repository found at https://github.com/krist00fer/ef-03-ci-cd-hands-on by first browsing to it and then clicking the “Fork” button up on the right hand-side of the root page for the GitHub repository.

Your challenge is now to setup a working CI/CD workflow using Azure DevOps for this repository. Any code pushed to the main branch should be built, tested and eventually deployed to an Azure Web App.

There are no more instructions to follow other than what you can find on online. Use this time to test that you are up for it.

Since the easy instructions are very similar to the harder instructions, you can jump over to the hard instructions if you have additional time.
