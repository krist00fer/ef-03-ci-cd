[![Build Status](https://dev.azure.com/ef03/ef03/_apis/build/status/krist00fer.ef-03-ci-cd?branchName=master)](https://dev.azure.com/ef03/ef03/_build/latest?definitionId=1&branchName=master)

During this session you are asked to setup a CI/CD workflow for yourself and potentially your team. This exercise will make sure that you have setup the basics, at least once. During this training you'll use GitHub as your hoster for Git Repositories, but the training and Azure DevOps works with any Git repository hoster (and for repositories hosted inside Azure DevOps).

## Pre-requisites

In order to complete this training, you need a GitHub user account, an Azure DevOps account and an active Azure Subscription.

> WARNING - Once you are done with this training, you might want to remove any deployed services in order not to incur any charges.

## The Challenge

Your challenge is to setup a similar repository to this one, where you will have implemented Continuous Integration and Deployment. Depending on what challenge level you want, your repository and pipelines might look a little bit different.

### [Hard](docs/instructions-hard.md)

You'll be on your own and have additional challenges beyond the simple workflow.

### [Medium](docs/instructions-medium.md)

The challenge will be to setup a simple CI/CD workflow but without instructions.

### [Easy](docs/instructions-easy.md)

You'll setup a simple CI/CD workflow using a step by step guide.
